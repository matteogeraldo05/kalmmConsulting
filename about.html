            <p>KALMM Consulting was founded in 2025 by five ambitious engineering graduates to address their shared conviction: our cities deserve better, more resilient stormwater systems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What began as a shared fascination with the built environment—from the way water flows beneath our streets to how infrastructure shapes daily life—has grown into a purpose-driven firm committed to exceeding expectations and implementing innovations. Our founding characteristics of knowledgeable members, adaptive design, long-term resilience, metric-driven analysis, and methodological rigor can be seen in all our work—principles that drive every stormwater solution we deliver.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At KALMM Consulting, we specialize in designing systems that don't just meet today's standards, but anticipate tomorrow's challenges—from climate change and flooding to urban densification and aging infrastructure. Our approach blends technical rigor with creative foresight, ensuring every project is both data-driven and human-centered. </p>
            <br>
            <p>From municipal masterplans to site-specific drainage solutions, we are proud to work alongside municipalities, developers, and other organizations who share our passion for building water-smart communities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We're not just consulting—we're reimagining what stormwater resilience looks like in the 21st century.</p>
